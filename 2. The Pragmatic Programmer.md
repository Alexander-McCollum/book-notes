## The Pragmatic Programmer

<summary><b>A Pragmatic Philosophy</b></summary>

#
- I have agency over where I work and what I do if I'm willing to seek opportunity
- No excuses
  - provide options and explain what can be done if a problem arises
- Don't let problems go unresolved
  - communicate with coworkers
  - actively address issues that arise as they are discovered
- Develop my project visions before discussing them
  - bright ideas must be demonstrated to be so, not explained
  - people will be much more willing to commit resources to your idea if there is a structure for them to build off of
- Don't let minor issues accululate
  - source code cannot be maintained with patches alone
  - root cause analysis will allow for sustainable frameworks
- Recognise when to stop working on something
  - over-engineering or setting impossible requisites are not productive
- Knowing how to learn is more valuable than knowledge itself
  - learn a new programming language every year
  - read a new book every month
  - network to find people who want to talk about topics relevant to whatever I'm studying
- Restrict non-API comments to saying *why* something is done
  - code should already shows *how* it's done
- Be an avid communicator
  - actively listen to my colleagues
  - always respond to emails and messages, even if to inform the other person I will get back to them later
  - know my audience and what I want to communicate to them
  - make my presentations visually appealing

<summary><b>A Pragmatic Approach</b></summary>

#
- Make code **easy to change**
  - every piece of knowledge should only have one representation
  - use accessor functions when possible to read and write attributes of objects
- Write **orthogonal** (decoupled) code
  - changes to any one function should not break the functionality of another
  - features should be easy to add, remove, or combine
- Develop **tracer code** to demonstrate a method or structure for a project
  - try to hit very specific goals with the architechture that does no more than prove an idea
  - once the proof-of-concept is made then the project can begin accumulating incremental functionality
- Build a **prototype** for tasks I'm new to or that carry risk
  - the purpose is to learn
  - it does *not* require correctness, completeness, robustness, or style
  - use expedient methods like whiteboards and sticky notes
- Practice making **time estimates** for projects
  - ask people with experience how long similar projects took them
  - develop a model of all the moving parts, define the parameters, and make a best guess
  - take care to use language that compliments the uncertainty
  - continue making estimates interatively as progress is made
  - track all estimates to compare with the final result

<summary><b>The Basic Tools</b></summary>

#
- **Plain text** is a very simple and widely used means of data storage
  - it can be easily read by humans and is thereby a good standard
  - virtually every computing tool can operate on plain text
  - it's easy to create version control systems and test
- **Shells** accelerate workflow
  - automate common tasks and write custom scripts
  - doesn't have nearly as many limitations as GUIs do
- Practice **power editing** to speed up repetitive tasks
  - navigate text editors without the use of a mouse
  - find tools to boost efficiency, and build them if they don't exist
- Use **version control** with everything
  - on teams it keeps developers from breaking each others code
  - it times of crisis, it will save numerous hours of restoration
- Practice root cause analysis when **debugging**
  - testing must be systematic and thorough
  - try to reproduce bugs by failing tests before attempting to fix them
  - read all error messages
  - use a binary search method to track down value errors in the stacktrace
  - use *tracing statements* (diagnostic print messages) for real-time, concurrent process, and event-based applications
  - *rubber ducking* is explaining the problem to another person, the act of which alone can help you solve it
  - try process of elimination, first with your code, then dependencies
  - don't assume sections of code work no matter your confidence, prove it does
  - think of what could have been done to prevent the bug and try to make similar bugs easier to handle in the future  
- Learn a **text manipulation** language such as Ruby or Python
  - useful for prototyping, or just simplifying projects
- Keep an **engineering daybook** while working to log the day's events
  - logs serve better than memory and help to sustain an efficient workflow

<summary><b>Pragmatic Paranoia</b></summary>

#
- **Design by contract** to ensure the program runs as expected
  - define the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants
    - these should be handled between the call and function execution
  - include the input range, boundary conditions, expected results, or anticipated undesirable results
  - this style helps to crash programs where the problem first occurs, which saves time debugging
  - it's more useful than simply running unit tests, as it is integrated into the software itself
- Remember that **dead programs tell no lies**
  - crashing is often better than trying to handle all errors and continue
  - a terminated program cannot propogate bad information
- use **assertions** to explicitly check for "impossible" results
  - if the parameter or results cannot be null, add `assert(result != null)` to make sure
  - do not use assertions in place of real error handling for more expected errors
  - keep assersions in production code, as it can provide valuable information for very rare and difficult to reproduce bugs
- **Balance resources** by finishing what you start
  - make functions and objects that allocate resources responsible for deallocating them
  - take advantage of scope reduction with statements like `do` in Ruby and `with` in Python
  - resources should be balanced over time as well, such as logs and debug files: which cannot pile up indefinitely
  - extend the idea to routines requiring multiple resources
    - deallocate in reverse order of allocation to prevent errors in resources that reference previous ones
    - if allocating indentical sets of resources in different places, keep them in the same order to prevent deadlock
  - make sure to handle issues in languages that support exceptions
    - utilize variable scope to ensure resources are deallocated automatically after an exception
    - use a `finally` clause in `try...catch` blocks to clean up any allocated resources if an exception is raised
  - incorporate balance checks in the code, such as wrappers, to track all allocations and deallocations
- always take small steps in programming, and take rate of feedback as a "speed limit" to know when steps are too big
  - don't try to guess too far into the future

<summary><b>Bend, or Break</b></summary>

#
- **Decoupling** ensures code is easier to change and harder to break
  - don't make a decision based on an object's internal state only to update that object
    - maintain object encapsulation by creating an internal method within the object that handles this process
  - don't chain method calls
    - keep the code no more than one level of abstraction deep
    - the exception is code very unlikely to change, such as methods from a language's standard library
  - avoid using global data as this creates an issue separating methods that utilize it from where the data is defined
    - hide the data behind methods and call them from there
    - wrap data that needs to be global, like a database, in an API so it is behind controllable code
  - be aware that inheritance adds coupling
