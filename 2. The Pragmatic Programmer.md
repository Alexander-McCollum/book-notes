# The Pragmatic Programmer

## A Pragmatic philosophy
- I have agency over where I work and what I do if I'm willing to seek opportunity
- No excuses
  - provide options and explain what can be done if a problem arises
- Don't let problems go unresolved
  - communicate with coworkers
  - actively address issues that arise as they are discovered
- Develop my project visions before discussing them
  - bright ideas must be demonstrated to be so, not explained
  - people will be much more willing to commit resources to your idea if there is a structure for them to build off of
- Don't let minor issues accululate
  - source code cannot be maintained with patches alone
  - root cause analysis will allow for sustainable frameworks
- Recognise when to stop working on something
  - over-engineering or setting impossible requisites are not productive
- Knowing how to learn is more valuable than knowledge itself
  - learn a new programming language every year
  - read a new book every month
  - network to find people who want to talk about topics relevant to whatever I'm studying
- Restrict non-API comments to saying *why* something is done
  - code should already shows *how* it's done
- Be an avid communicator
  - actively listen to my colleagues
  - always respond to emails and messages, even if to inform the other person I will get back to them later
  - know my audience and what I want to communicate to them
  - make my presentations visually appealing
